# ðŸ“‹ Netlify Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment
- [x] netlify.toml created
- [x] requirements.txt generated
- [x] runtime.txt set to Python 3.11
- [x] netlify/functions/api.py created
- [x] .gitignore configured

## Git Setup

```

## Netlify Setup
1. [ ] Create account at https://app.netlify.com
2. [ ] Click "Add new site" â†’ "Import an existing project"
3. [ ] Connect to GitHub and select repository
4. [ ] Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Publish directory: `frontend_static`
   - Functions directory: `netlify/functions`
5. [ ] Add environment variables:
   ```
   WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   PYTHON_VERSION=3.11
   ```
6. [ ] Click "Deploy site"

## Post-Deployment
1. [ ] Test landing page loads
2. [ ] Test API endpoint: `https://your-site.netlify.app/api/weather/current`
3. [ ] Update Clerk dashboard with Netlify URL:
   - Authorized redirect URLs
   - Sign-out URLs
4. [ ] Test login flow
5. [ ] Test dashboard loads with data
6. [ ] Test mobile responsiveness
7. [ ] Test weather integration
8. [ ] Test all pages (Home, Farms, Claims, Weather, Admin)

## Optional Enhancements
- [ ] Set up custom domain
- [ ] Configure Netlify Analytics
- [ ] Set up form notifications
- [ ] Enable deploy previews for PRs
- [ ] Set up branch deploys for staging

## Verification URLs
Replace `your-site-name` with your actual Netlify site name:

- Landing: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app/`
- Login: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app/login.html`
- Dashboard: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app/dashboard.html`
- API: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app/api/weather/current`

## Troubleshooting
If build fails:
1. Check Netlify build logs
2. Verify requirements.txt has all dependencies
3. Ensure Python version matches runtime.txt
4. Check netlify.toml syntax

If functions don't work:
1. Check Functions tab in Netlify dashboard
2. View function logs for errors
3. Verify api.py imports correctly
4. Check environment variables are set

## Success Criteria
âœ… Site is live and accessible
âœ… All pages load without errors
âœ… API endpoints return data
âœ… Clerk authentication works
âœ… Weather data displays
âœ… Mobile navigation works
âœ… Forms are functional
